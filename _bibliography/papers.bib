  title={Lossless Face Anonymization on Downstream Tasks},
  author={Zhangyu Jin and Siddharth Agrawal and Yanyan Hu},
  abstract={Completed Face Anonymization by substituting each face with a similar one from the fakely generated face gallery, effectively hiding facial information from all users. Utilized as both the training and testing data to guarantee no decline in performance for all downstream tasks (ReID, Object Detection).},
